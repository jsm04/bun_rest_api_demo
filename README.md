# Project Description

## REST API Demo with Bun and Hono

This REST API demo showcases a simple user management system built using Bun and the Hono framework. The API allows clients to interact with user data efficiently, providing endpoints for retrieving, updating, and deleting user accounts. Designed for simplicity and performance, this demo serves as a foundational template for more complex applications.
